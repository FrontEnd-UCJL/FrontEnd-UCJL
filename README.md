Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

# Samsung DesArrolladoras 2022 Project Showcase

Welcome to the GitHub organization dedicated to showcasing my work completed during the Samsung DesArrolladoras 2022 course. This comprehensive training program, facilitated by Bejob and accredited by Universidad Camilo JosÃ© Cela, focused on introducing and developing skills in web development.

## About This Organization
This organization serves as a central hub for the projects I developed during the Samsung DesArrolladoras 2022 course. Spanning over 34 weeks with 350 hours of training, this program was structured into three distinct levels, each level building upon the previous one in complexity and depth.

### Course Structure and Content
- **Block 1**: An introduction to web development, covering basic programming concepts, HTML, and CSS over 40 hours (4 weeks).
- **Block 2**: A deeper dive into Front-End development using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, spanning 140 hours (14 weeks). This block included practical projects like creating layouts for a blog and an online store.

## Project Overview
Within this organization, you will find repositories that contain the projects and exercises I completed during the course. These projects reflect the skills and knowledge I acquired in web development, particularly in the areas of:

- **HTML & CSS**: Building the foundation of web development, focusing on structure and design.
- **JavaScript**: Introduction to programming dynamic web content.
- **Front-End Development**: Creating responsive and interactive web layouts.

## Navigation Tips
- Each repository corresponds to a specific project or set of exercises.
- Detailed README files within each repository provide insights into the objectives, the technologies used, and the learning outcomes of each project.

## Getting Started
Feel free to navigate through the repositories to explore my projects. The README in each repository will guide you through the project details and the learning journey associated with it.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope my project provides insight into the learning process and skills developed during the Samsung DesArrolladoras 2022 course!
